<div id="div8"><h1>Technique</h1></div>
        <h3>This is the technique of all of the elements that you found in the glossary. This is also very important in Kung Fu because the better technique you have, the more power you will have.</h3>
            <hr>
        <div id="div9"><h2>Punches/Strikes</h2></div>
        <h3>Most punches in Hung Gar are twisting punches where you twist your hand at the last second so that you accelerate your punch, generating more power. </h3>
            <hr>
        <div id="div10"><h2>Kicks</h2></div>
        <h3>The technique for having a powerful kick is first of all being in balance on the leg that you are standing on and bending it slightly. For round-house and side kicks don't just use your legs, also use your hip and turn it with your leg to make your kicks stronger.</h3>
            <hr>
        <div id="div11"><h2>Blocks</h2></div>
        <h3>When you block you should use large motions like in Long Sau you start with your hand down and then block above your head, so for every type of block make sure to do the correct motion before it. </h3>
            <hr>
        <div id="div12"><h2>Stances</h2></div>
        <h3>For stances, the general rule is to line up your front toe with your back heel, but there are some exceptions like the horse stance.</h3>
