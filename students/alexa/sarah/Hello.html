        <h2>Our story: </h2>
        <h3>It all began on a sunny summer day on a little island, abundant with grass that is sturdy yet light. Since the founder, Naomi was super bored, she got the brilliant idea of using the grass to create jewelry, founding the first biodegradible jewelry line. At first we made some simple chockers, headbands, braclets, but we soon started to create intricate earings, edgy knuckle rings, and "The Grasshopper", sure to be selling for millions of dollars. </h3>
