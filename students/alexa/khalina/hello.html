    <h1>Shih tzu's</h1>
        shih tzus have a nickname of Chinese Lion Dog and Chrysanthemum Dog.<br>
        and the name of the shih tzu is derived from the Chinese word for lion dog, and was actully bred to resemble lions for in traditional Chinese art. Although the origins of the Shih Tzu is unknown, DNA evidence suggests the breed is closely related to the "Papillon", Long-haired Chihuahua, Pug, and other breeds that originated in China. and, a recent study concluded that the Shih Tzu is among the 14 oldest dog breeds, and bones found in China reveales the breed’s presence in the country as early as 8,000 B.C. Commonly depicted in Chinese paintings, the Shih Tzu was a prized breed and the favorite of Chinese royalty when Empress Dowager Tzu-hsi became a regent during the Manchu Dynasty. In the 1930’s, the Shih Tzu arrived in America and later became an official breed by the American Kennel Club in 1969.<br>
