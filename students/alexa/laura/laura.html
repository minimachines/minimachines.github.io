		<h1>My Alexa Cafe Experience</h1>

		<p>On Monday we were inroduced to the basic html and css format <br> and layout. We also learned some simple html commands<br> like br ans hr. We were given time to explore the html and css commands<br> and their outcomes on a page.  </p>

		<h2>Tuesday</h2>
		<p>Tuesday was the first work day for our websites. I decided<br> to make a website about dance and I strated implementing <br> my ideas into code. I also learned to link my css commands<br> to decorate my page. </p>

I also learned how to<br> embed videos from YouTube onto my website and group things together <br>using div.   </p>

		<h2>Thursday</h2>
		<p>Thursday was the day for finishing touches on the websites. I completed<br> all the needed pages for the navigation bar and I verified all my code. I also<br> learned how to make a Magic 8 Ball using jacascript arrays and the random Math <br> function. I also added a horoscope page and a navigation bar to the Magic 8 Ball<br> website.
            
            <h2>Favorite Camp Memory</h2>
		<p>My favorite experience from this week was being able share about something<br> that I feel passionate for. I really enjoyed the feeling of being able to control my <br>own project and create whatever I wanted without any limits. It felt really rewarding<br> to look back at what I created after putting is so much hard work and time.  </p>
