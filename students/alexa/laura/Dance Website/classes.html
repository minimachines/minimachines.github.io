I have attended this studio for only 2 years, yet I truly feel as part of the family. The community there is amazing, all the girls get along and the coaches are like our friends. Each year Infiniti hosts a much anticipated end of the year performance that showcasses all the hard work put into the training. The head coach of Infiniti comes from the most famous dance crew in Russia; Todes. <br> Classes: <br>During the classes, time is put into warmup, stretching, technique, and choreography that is performed at the end of the year. Infiniti offers ballroom classes led by Umario and modern classes led by the head coach; Olga. Umario is a professional ballroom dancer with multiple studios in San Francisco and Washington. He also participated in So You Think You Can Dance as a choreographer. The classes are sorted by age and any dance background is accepted, even none!  Each class is 1.5 hours and classes are 2 times a week. If you are looking for somewhere to start with a very supportive atmosphere, then Dance School infiniti is defintely for you!  <br> Address: <br> 12815 NE 124th St O, Kirkland, WA 98034  <br> Phone: <br>(425) 269-8174 </div>
