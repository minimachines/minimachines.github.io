        <div id="div1"><h4>Description: <br><br>Locking is a style of funk dance that is often associated with hip hop. This dance style gets its name from the concept of locking movements, meaning freezing from a fast movement and "locking" in a certain position for a short while then continuing in the normal speed. Locking requires fast and distincr arm and hand movements combined with relaxed hips and legs. During performances, interactive movements like high-fives are often used. THis dance also includes a lot of acrobatics and physically demanding moves, such as landing on knees and splits. A person who dances locking is called a locker. Lockers may perform solo dances or in unision with 2 or more dancers. Important stylistic features include waving arms, pointing, walking stationary and grabbing and rotating a cap or hat. By nature, locking is an improvisational dance but also consists of a set of signature movements of locking pioneers. Many lockers alter or blend the origional moves to create their own variation.   </h4>

        <div id="div1"><h4>Moves: <br> <br>Jazz Split- This move is a semi-split done with one leg bent, allowing the dancer to get back up in one swift move. <br> <br>Knee Drop- For this popular move, the dancer drops to the knees while keeping them in an inward position (w-shape). <br> <br>Up Lock (Muscle Man)- The dancer must first take the macho man pose, kepping the arms above the shoulders. The pose is usually held for a moment or two. <br> <br>  Stop and Go- This movement starts of with the muscle man (up lock), then the dancer steps back with one foot and punches. Next, the dancer completes a quarter turn in the direction of the back foot breakdown once, and then returns reach-around to the same position. <br> <br> Funky Guitar- The dancer positions their hands as if holding a guitar, and start walking backwards. <br> <br> Wrist Twirl- For this simple move, the dancer twists their wrists while moving their ams upward.  </h4> </div> <br><br>
