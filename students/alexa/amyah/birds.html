        This is my story about Birds. I like the birds that have colorful wings becuse there wings are butteful. I just like all of the diffrent colors on the birds. I also like blue and red birds. I like blue birds because my favorite color is blue and I like red because red is a pretty color to me. All birds are pretty but these ones are more pretty.
