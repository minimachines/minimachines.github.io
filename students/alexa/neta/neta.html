		<h1>MY WEEK AT ALEXA CAFE</h1>
		
		<h2>Monday</h2>
          <p>Monday was the day when I realized that <br> coding was really fun. That day I started <br> coding "Neta's Useless Rambles" using the basic <br> html commands, such as hr, br, and headers, <br>we learned from CeCe, our instructor. She didn't exactly tell us <br> what to do except for "play around with them" and <br>that's how I got my first page "The Beginning". </p>
            <br>
		<h2>Tuesday</h2>
		  <p>Tuesday was when I finished my first <br>website, although, it was more for fun than <br>professional. Thanks to css, I made it look like a <br>journal and all fun. </p>
            <br>
		<h2>Wednesday</h2>
		  <p>On Wednesday, I started my website on <br> Russia, the website I feel most proud of. I had <br> soooooo many ideas for it I doubted I would actually finish.<br> We even had time to talk with other classes to <br> get more ideas like what to add and what to change.</p>
            <br>
		<h2>Thursday</h2>
		  <p>On Thursday, I finished my second website to my surprise<br> and it turned out great! I also learned how to <br>make buttons and succesfully made and added a <br>"Test Yourself" page on my website. My <br>bonus question was the best as well, I was able<br> to make a box for you to type the answer in<br> and the when you press submit the page would say<br> that it's wrong and asks if you want to reveal <br>the answer or it says correct.</p>
            <br>
		<h2>Favorite Camp Memory</h2>
		  <p>My favorite memory from this week was <br>probably when I finished writing my <br>last command and looked at my website. I felt accomplished <br>at that moment.</p>
