        <h3> You see, I'm not really good when it comes to choices unless someone says something like</h3>
        <h3>    "Ok, if you can't decide then we are taking this one" or "We are taking this one in five, four, three, tw--"</h3>
        <h3>    "No, I want this one then" I would say or something like "Oh yeah, let's take that one"</h3>
        <h3> Soon, the school year of 2017-2018 will begin, and guess what, I can't decide on my after school classes.</h3>
