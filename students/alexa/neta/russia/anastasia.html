        <h4> After the revolution, many rumors went around about the daughter of Nicholas the second, Anastasia Romanova. No one knew exactly because many are dead, others are now old and we can never be sure if it is just their imagination or the truth. </h4>
        <br><hr><br>
        <h4> It is said that before they were shot, the Romanov family put jewelry under their shirts because they didn't know what was going to happen with them. When Anasasia was shot, some say she was hit in the jewelry under her shirt and survived. It's believed that she couldn't remember who she was when she came to.</h4>
