        <h4> Rasputin, as you can tell in the picture, does look a little menacing, and the text you are about to read is just as horrible. If you read the page on Nicholas the second, you will know that his son suffered form a disease where one papercut could be his last. Whenever he fell ill, it was Rasputin, who prayed for the Czar's son, not a doctor. No one knows exactly what he did, but whatever it was, it worked. Yusupov, a man in a rich family, believed that Rasputin had too strong of a grip on the queen and it was time to get rid of him. </h4>

        <h6> Yusupov and his wife</h6>

        <h4> So, Yusupov and his friends gathered and began to plot. They invited Rasputin to meet his wife who was having a "party". This fake party consisted of his friends who turned on music so as to sound like they were dancing. Rasputin was told to wait in the basement where they set up a table with tea and pastries. Not surprisingly, the pastries were poisoned. Rasputin refused to drink the tea for he was cautious but was convinced to try the pastries. He ate five but still wasn't dead. Under the excuse for checking on the party, Yusupov climbed the stairs to tell his friends the bad news. In the end he came down with a gun and shot Rasputin. Hearing the gunshot, Yusupov's friends assumed he was dead. Upon checking for breath, Rasputin kicked Yusupov away, sprang onto his feet, and ran out the door. He was shot 3 times including once in the head in the yard and carried into a truck. Yusupov drove up to a frozen lake where they shoved him into a hole they had formed. Rasputin was alive when this happened and kicked and kicked until he finally went limp. Scientists later reported that he had died from freezing, not losing breath. In my opinion, Rasputin's only weakness was the cold, otherwise, he was invincible. The Yusupov family was banished from Russia which thankfully saved them from the revolution that later occured. </h4>
