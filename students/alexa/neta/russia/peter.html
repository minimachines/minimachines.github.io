        <h4> Peter the Great was the 1st Czar of Russia. He was known to be tall, strong, healthy, and have a small moustache. He even visited Holland where he learned to build boats. When he arrived back in Russia, he taught workers. The customs and and building where the boats were made still stand in St.Petersburg Russia.</h4>

        <h4> Surprisingly, Peter owned 2 houses on each side of the main river, Neva. One bedroom, one kitchen, and the third was his work shop. Now only one wall of his house stands. Of course, he also had the winter and summer palace, peterhof, and many more. </h4>
