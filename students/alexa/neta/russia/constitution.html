        <h4> One day in December, senators stood around the statue of Peter the Great, asking the czar for a constitution. Suddenly, someone thought they heard a shot and decided to shoot, and so, a fight began. Obviously, the gaurds won and all those living were arrested. Four were hung. These people were called the Dekabrists(deh-kah-brie-sti is how it'a pronounced in russian). Decabr meant December which they were named after. Many decabriste were sent to Peter the Great's fortress where they put to work in brutal conditions. Others were sent to Siberia. Czar had said no to any chances of the constitution.  </h4>
