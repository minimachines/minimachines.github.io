        <h1>CODING 101 WITH THEO AT ID TECH</h1>
	    <p>This week we learned about html css and javascript. Here are the things we did every day of the week except for friday beacause that would be today.</p>
        
        <h2>Monday</h2>
        <p>On the first day of camp we made a website that could be about whatever you want. It mainly used html but it did use some css and javascript. I made mine about pizza.</p>
        
        <h2>Tusday</h2>
        <p>On Tusday I made a magic eight ball game. It used a lot of html and a lot of javascript. You would type in something you want to learn the answer to, and then you would hit shake and it would give you a answer.</p>
        
        <h2>Wensday</h2>
        <p>On Wensday I tried to made a game from the id tech page that used a lot of html code but it did not work at all so instead we made a website about one of the staff at id tech. I wrote about the director named "director X".</p>
        
        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p>On Thursday I kept working on my website about director X, but I also started a new game that used a lot of javascript. How you play is that your mouse is a big gold dot and you are tring to touch the black dots, but every time you touch one it respons somewhere else.</p>
        
        <h2>Favorite camp memory</h2>
        <p>My favorite camp memoryh is when machine was talking about something my and sekoy didn't understand and we both glanced at eachother.</p>
