        <h1>Director X</h1>
      <p>The director's name is "Director X" and on Tuesday he tried to teach me coding by showing me a video about Javascript, but he got bored about 15 seconds in and sent me back to my coding class. Also, there are tickets that you get by having good behavior and listening and stuff like that. At the end of the week, there is a big raffle and one of the things you can win is to pie one of the staff at iD Tech with a shaving cream pie. So at the start of the week he gave a ten minute speech about how you shoud pie someone with hair because he is bald and beacause he didn't want to get pied. He said that if you pie someone with hair it will be stuck there for a long time, but if you pie someone who's bald the shaving cream will just slide off. That is why you should pie the director.</p>
